First we need to initialize our project. You can use _NPM_ or _Yarn_. I like Yarn, so we'll use that.
If you'd like to use npm instead just look up the cooresponding commands for npm, they're not much different.

```
yarn init -y
```

# Install Webpack

Next, we need Webpack. Webpack is the library that enables us to bundle our code so it can served in the browser.
Now, you may be thinking, _but can't the browser just run Javascript without it being bundled?_ And yes, you'd be right.
However, if you're building a site for deployment, for actual users, you want your code to to be bundled. If you're not
familiar with what "bundling" actually means, give it a google. There are some good articles dedicated to explaining it.
Essentially, though, it's the process combining all your Javascript files into one or just a few minified files to make
it easier on the network and browser by reducing the file size and number of files coming from the server.

```
yarn add -D webpack @types/webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server webpack-merge html-webpack-plugin @types/html-webpack-plugin clean-webpack-plugin
```

Why do we need _all_ of these libraries, though? Are they necessary? Well, yes and no, depending on what you want.

### webpack

`webpack` is the main library. We need it for all the things to come.

### @types/webpack

These are the type definitions for webpack. Since we're using Typescript we want that.

### webpack-cli

You need this to actually run the webpack commands via the command line.

### webpack-dev-server

You need this if you want to develop locally and have all the hot module reloading goodness.

### webpack-merge

This one is not necessary, but it allows us to have multiple webpack configs for different environments.

### html-webpack-plugin

This one is also not necessary. But, it makes it easy to inject the bundled Javascript file into the `index.html` page.

### @types/html-webpack-plugin

This is just for the types for the above package - needed because of Typescript.

### clean-webpack-plugin

This package is used for cleaning up the build output folder before a new build - also not necessary, but we _do_ want to always do what it enables.
There are other ways to accomplish this task, but installing this package is probably the cleanest way, especially since we're already using webpack.

# Install Typescript

Now, we just need to install Typescript and React. Let's start with Typescript.

### typescript

```
yarn add -D typescript ts-loader ts-node
```

# Install React

# Configure Webpack

# Configure Typescript

# Configure React
