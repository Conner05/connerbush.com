In my previous post I wrote about the Context API, prop drilling, and composition.
We learned that sometimes state management problems can be solved simply by how we structure our components, not using Context.
It's important to at least _try_ using composition first. If it doesn't work, then you can always reach for Context state management.

# Advanced State Management with Context and Custom Hooks

There is a common pattern often used with Context that is worth introducing now. To achieve this we'll utilize **custom hooks**,
a topic I haven't covered yet. However, this will serve as a soft introduction to custom hooks and teach us an advanced means of
handling context at the same time - a win-win!

Let's start out with the component we refactored using composition from m previous post on Context.

```jsx
function AppWithComposition() {
  const [user, setUser] = useState()
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1 style={{ color: 'green' }}>Now we're in the App</h1>
      <Header />
      {user ? (
        <Content>
          <ContentBody>
            <ContentBodyHeader user={user} />
          </ContentBody>
          <button onClick={() => setUser(null)}>Logout</button>
        </Content>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={() => setUser({ name: 'Conner' })}>Login</button>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}
```

This met our needs, but let's say there are several other components, maybe even separate page routes that need access
to `user` and it just doesn't make sense to use composition to compose all of those components inside `AppWithComposition`
anymore. That's a perfect example of how Context can and should be applied. Instead of implementing it like we did before,
though. We're only going to change one line in our `AppWithComposition`. The rest of the changes will happen in other files.

```jsx
import { useUser } from './user.context'

function AppWithComposition() {
  const [user, setUser] = useUser()
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1 style={{ color: 'green' }}>Now we're in the App</h1>
      <Header />
      {user ? (
        <Content>
          <ContentBody>
            <ContentBodyHeader user={user} />
          </ContentBody>
          <button onClick={() => setUser(null)}>Logout</button>
        </Content>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={() => setUser({ name: 'Conner' })}>Login</button>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}
```

Do you see what changed? It's subtle, but makes a huge difference. We changed `useState` to `useUser`.
But wait, React doesn't offer a `useUser` hook? That's right. React doesn't. But, React allows us to create our own _custom hooks_.
Let's take a closer look.

We imported `useUser` from a file `user.context.js`. Let's take a look at what's in that file.

```jsx
import React, { useState, useContext } from 'react'

const UserContext = React.createContext()

const UserProvider = props => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState({})
  return <UserContext.Provider value={[user, setUser]} {...props} />
}

const useUser = () => {
  const contextValue = useContext(UserContext)
  if (contextValue === undefined) {
    throw new Error('useUser must be used within a UserProvider')
  }
  return contextValue
}

export { UserProvider, useUser }
```

The first logic we come to is familiar, `const UserContext = React.createContext()`. That's how we define a Context. Now, what we would typically do is just wrap the containing component(s) in a `Provider`, passing it a `value`, and then call `useContext` from our consumer components in order to access `value`. That works, but the code above provides another layer of abstraction. The first function we come to is `UserProvider`. This function is essentially a wrapper for the `Provider`.

```jsx
const UserProvider = props => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState()
  return <UserContext.Provider value={[user, setUser]} {...props} />
}
```

What we've done is abstract the state from the root component from which the `Provider` would typically be called and placed them together in their own component. This makes sense. Why? Otherwise, we would've been declaring `user` with `useState` inside our `AppWithComposition` component, even though it's not needed there. Now, we have a nice layer of abstraction that allows for a separation of concerns.

We understand `useState` by now, but let's take a closer look at the `return` statement.

```jsx
return <UserContext.Provider value={[user, setUser]} {...props} />
```

The `Provider` component is the same as we learned in our first lesson on Context. However, now our `value` looks a little different. We're used to seeing just one value passed into the `value` prop on `Provider`. However, we're not limited in that. What we did instead is pass both our state and state setter method as an array, just as it looks destructured from `useState`. We'll see why shortly. Next, we spread `props` into the `Provider`. This is a throwback all the way to one of our first few lessons on components. React will take those props and put them individually on the `Provider` component. For our purposes, we'll be making use of the built-in `children` prop, which, again, we'll see shortly.

The next function is where we set up our **custom hook**. The custom hook is intended to return the `value` that we set for the Context.

```jsx
const useUser = () => {
  const contextValue = useContext(UserContext)
  if (contextValue === undefined) {
    throw new Error('useUser must be used within a UserProvider')
  }
  return contextValue
}
```

We added some extra logic to throw an error if the custom hook is used outside of a `Provider`. That's an important point to note. One of the pitfalls we pointed out for Context was that you must be "in scope". In other words, the component using the Context `value` must exist inside the Context's `Provider`. It may not always be clear where that is. What's great about this abstraction is that it makes finding a bug like that easier to track down by conveniently allowing us to throw such an error.

Earlier we said this:

_We're used to seeing just one value passed into the `value` prop on `Provider`. However, we're not limited in that. What we did instead is pass both our state and state setter method as an array, just as it looks destructured from `useState`. We'll see why shortly._

With this hook, `useUser`, we can simply call it like we do `useState`. And, because we set the `Provider`'s `value` with an array of the variables returned from `useState` we can destructure our Context just like we destructure `useState`. Aren't custom hooks awesome?!

```jsx
import { useUser } from './user.context'

function AppWithComposition() {
  const [user, setUser] = useUser()
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1 style={{ color: 'green' }}>Now we're in the App</h1>
      <Header />
      {user ? (
        <Content>
          <ContentBody>
            <ContentBodyHeader user={user} />
          </ContentBody>
          <button onClick={() => setUser(null)}>Logout</button>
        </Content>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={() => setUser({ name: 'Conner' })}>Login</button>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}
```

Now, we can see that `useUser` is in place of `useState` and that's **the only change** we had to make for this component. The rest of the logic was abstracted away from us.

You may be wondering, _Okay, I see the `useUser`, but where is the `UserProvider` component we defined?_ Going back to something said earlier:

_React will take those props and put them individually on the `Provider` component. For our purposes, we'll be making use of the built-in `children` prop, which, again, we'll see shortly._

In our `index.js` file, where `AppWithComposition` is actually being rendered, we'll see our `UserProvider` in action.

```jsx
ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <UserProvider>
      <AppWithComposition />
    </UserProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root'),
)
```

Now, everything inside `AppWithComposition` can use the `useUser` hook we created.

# Summary

We've seen another example of managing state with Context. However, this implementation is more advanced,
adding a layer of abstraction. We've also seen an example of a **custom hook**. Custom hooks give us powerful
flexibility that we can use to really be expressive and concise with our code.
